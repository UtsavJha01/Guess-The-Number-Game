HOW THE GAME WORKS

1. The computer selects a random number between 0 and 500.
2. The user enters a guess.
3. The program gives hints:
   - If guess is higher → It tells the number is lower.
   - If guess is lower → It tells the number is higher.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
5. Total attempts are displayed at the end.
